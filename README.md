Journal

Gratitude journal tracker/log built with React and NodeJS, utilizing MongoDB, Express, and Mongoose
For this project, I set out to build a fully-functional gratitude journal utilizing the MERN stack. 

I started the project using the create-react-app boilerplate, and it incorporates vanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. 

The main purpose for this project was to gain familiarity with databases and backend development.
